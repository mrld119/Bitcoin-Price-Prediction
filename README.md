# Bitcoin Price Prediction

This project aims to predict Bitcoin prices using machine learning techniques. The notebook includes steps for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to forecast future price trends based on historical data.

## Introduction

Bitcoin is one of the most volatile cryptocurrencies in the world, making it an interesting challenge for price prediction. This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict Bitcoin prices using historical data, feature engineering, and model evaluation metrics.

## Features

* Data preprocessing (handling missing data, scaling)
* Feature engineering (time-based features, moving averages, etc.)
* Machine learning model training and evaluation
* Data visualization for insights and trends

## Installation

Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bitcoin-price-prediction.git`

## Usage

* Open the Bitcoin_Price_Prediction.ipynb notebook.
* Follow the step-by-step instructions to load the data, preprocess it, and build machine learning models.
* Evaluate the model and analyze predictions.

## Results

The model is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to ensure the accuracy of price predictions. Graphs and plots are used to visualize historical trends and forecast results.
