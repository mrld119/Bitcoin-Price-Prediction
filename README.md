#Bitcoin Price Prediction
This project aims to predict Bitcoin prices using machine learning techniques. The notebook includes steps for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to forecast future price trends based on historical data.

#Introduction
Bitcoin is one of the most volatile cryptocurrencies in the world, making it an interesting challenge for price prediction. This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict Bitcoin prices using historical data, feature engineering, and model evaluation metrics.

#Features
Data preprocessing (handling missing data, scaling)
Feature engineering (time-based features, moving averages, etc.)
Machine learning model training and evaluation
Data visualization for insights and trends
